After any significant change in development, create a descriptive git commit and push the change to the remote repository.

Guidance:
- Use clear, imperative commit messages that summarize the change.
- Group related edits in a single commit; avoid mixing unrelated changes.
- Push promptly after committing to keep the remote up to date.
